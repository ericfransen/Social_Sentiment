# SocialSentiment

SocialSentiment is an app that aims to employ 
[NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) 
to analyze how people are talking about certain topics.

SocialSentiment will be using AlchemyAPI's 
[Sentiment Analysis API](http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/sentiment-analysis)
to understand how people are talking about topics they are interested in.

SS will begin by analyzing Twitter and StackOverflow.
